## 💡 Scientific outreach

### Team manager for the "Tribulations Savantes" (edition 2019)

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Over the course of a year, I coordinated a small team dedicated to staging this event, taking on a variety of responsibilities: managing the team, recruiting speakers to carry out experiments with young people, inviting speakers, organizing a photo competition, managing logistics, as well as designing and implementing communication actions. This experience enabled me to develop invaluable organizational and interpersonal skills, while deepening my commitment to sharing scientific knowledge.

### Other events  

<p style="text-align: justify;">
At the same time, I also contributed to other popular science events. For example, I gave a talk on the job of a researcher at <strong>Les Mondes Inconnus 2019 festival</strong>, and ran a stand on pollution in Grenoble, with interactive experiments accessible to all, at the <strong>Fête des Tuiles 2019</strong>. These enriching experiences reinforced my conviction of the importance of making scientific knowledge accessible to as many people as possible.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A few years earlier, in 2016, I had taken the Animation Scientifique teaching unit, during which I learned how to address different types of audience and design scientific mediation actions. The validation of this training led to the realization of a scientific animation at the <strong>School of the Second Chance<s/trong> in Grenoble, a structure that accompanies young people aged 16 to 25 in a situation of school dropouts.
