  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <p>We describe a new field campaign over a steep, snowy 30-degree alpine slope, designed to investigate three recurrent issues in experimental studies of steep-slope katabatic winds. (1) Entrainment is known to be present in katabatic jets and has been estimated at the interface between the jet and the boundary layer above it. However, to our knowledge, the slope-normal velocity component has never been measured in the katabatic jet. (2) It is hard to accurately measure turbulence in the first tens of centimeters above the surface using standard sonic anemometry due to the filtering effect of the long instrument path. The present field experiment used a three-dimensional multi-hole pitot-type probe with a high sampling frequency (1250 Hz) that was positioned as close to the surface as 3 cm. It provides three-dimensional mean velocity and Reynolds stress tensor from which dissipation can be estimated, as well as spectra for the turbulent quantities. Energy spectra reveal a well-developed inertial range and capture the inertial scales and some of the dissipative scales. (3) Measuring turbulence on a mast usually provides information about mean and turbulent quantities at certain discrete heights because the sensors are sparsely located inside the jet. We present the first measurements of well-developed katabatic flows where the full wind-speed and temperature profiles acquired, from tethered balloon are available at the location of the measurement mast, which comprises three-dimensional anemometry and thermometry.</p>

  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <p>Katabatic winds are very frequent but poorly understood or simulated over steep slopes. This study focuses on a katabatic jet above a steep alpine slope. We assess the buoyancy terms in both the turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and the Reynolds shear-stress budget equations. We specifically focus on the contribution of the slope-normal and along-slope turbulent sensible heat fluxes to these terms. Four levels of measurements below and above the maximum wind-speed height enable analysis of the buoyancy effect along the vertical profile as follow: (i) buoyancy tends to destroy TKE, as expected in stable conditions, and the turbulent momentum flux in the inner-layer region of the jet below the maximum wind-speed height z j ; (ii) results also suggest buoyancy contributes to the production of TKE in the outer-layer shear region of the jet (well above z j ) while consumption of the turbulent momentum flux is observed in the same region; (iii) In the region around the maximum wind speed where mechanical shear production is marginal, buoyancy tends to destroy TKE and our results suggest it tends to increase the momentum flux. The present study also provides an analytical condition for the limit between production and consumption of the turbulent momentum flux due to buoyancy as a function of the slope angle, similar to the condition already proposed for TKE. We reintroduce the stress Richardson number, which is the equivalent of the flux Richardson number for the Reynolds shear-stress budget. We point out that the flux Richardson number and the stress Richardson number are complementary stability parameters for characterizing the katabatic flow apart from the region around the maximum wind-speed height.</p>

  <strong>Abstract:</strong>
  <p>Atmospheric moisture convergence on ice sheets provides an estimate of snow accumulation, which is critical to quantifying sea-level changes. In the case of East Antarctica, we computed moisture transport from 1980 to 2016 in five reanalyses and in radiosonde observations. Moisture convergence in reanalyses is more consistent than net precipitation but still ranges from 72 to 96 mm&middot;yr&minus;1 in the four most recent reanalyses, ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR, JRA 55 and MERRA 2. The representation of long-term variability in reanalyses is also inconsistent, which justified resorting to observations. Moisture fluxes are measured on a daily basis via radiosondes launched from a network of stations surrounding East Antarctica. Observations agree with reanalyses on the major role of extreme advection events and transient eddy fluxes. Although assimilated, the observations reveal processes that reanalyses cannot model, some due to a lack of horizontal and vertical resolution, especially the oldest, NCEP DOE R2. Additionally, the observational time series are not affected by new satellite data unlike the reanalyses. We formed pan-continental estimates of convergence by aggregating anomalies from all available stations. We found statistically significant trends neither in moisture convergence nor in precipitable water.</p>
