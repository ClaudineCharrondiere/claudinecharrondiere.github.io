abstract: "The katabatic winds on steep slopes investigated in the present study reveal a novel spectral behavior, observed in the outer part of the jet. At low wavenumbers, the one-dimensional (1D) velocity spectra show evidence of a \( k_x^{-1} \) range for the three components of the velocity vector: \( E_u(k_x) \), \( E_v(k_x) \), \( E_w(k_x) \) [as well as for the 1D temperature spectrum \( E_\theta(k_x) \propto k_x^{-1} \)]. This suggests the existence of strong wave turbulence. A necessary condition for strong wave turbulence to be manifest is that the flow direction wavenumber, \( k_\varphi \), extends to much lower values than the slope normal one, \( k_z \). This is satisfied in the present field experiment where wave energy is injected at wavenumber \( k_x = k_y = (N_a \sin \alpha) / \bar{u}_j \), while \( k_z \propto 1 / \Delta z \), with \( N_a \) the ambient stratification, \( \alpha \) the slope angle, \( \bar{u}_j \) the maximum wind velocity, and \( \Delta z \) the shear layer thickness of the jet. In the inertial range, the velocity spectra exhibit a power law \( k_x^{-5/3} \) over two decades, whereas the temperature-buoyancy spectra show evidence of a \( -7/5 \) slope in the buoyancy sub-range, followed by a \( -5/3 \) slope. The change in spectral slopes occurs at the Bolgiano scale \( L_B \) that is close to the Dougherty–Ozmidov scale \( L_OZ \). The high Reynolds number based on the Taylor micro-scale, \( Re_\lambda \sim 10^3 \), allows clear identification of the spectral laws."
